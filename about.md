Hey there, Casper here!

I'm a software developer in my thirties and been doing this thing professionaly
for about a decade.

Currently working full time on Deno, but not for Deno.

Meaning that I am completely funded by GitHub sponsorships and the community
gets to puppeteer what I work on and ar gue to get into the runtime (provided
that it is reasonable).
